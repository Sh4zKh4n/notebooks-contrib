In this notebook, we will demonstrate how cuML allows you to develop an entire machine learning _pipeline_ in order to preprocess and prepare your data without _ever_ leaving the GPU.\n",

    "We will use the [BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management) to showcase a few of the many methods that cuML offers for GPU-accelerated feature engineering. This dataset offers an interesting challenge because:\n",
    "1. It is somewhat messy, including missing data of various kinds.\n",
    "2. It includes both quantitative data (represented as floating point values) and categorical data (represented as both integers and strings).\n",
    "3. It is anonymized, so we cannot use _a priori_ domain-specific knowledge to guide our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here is not necessarily to achieve the best possible model performance but to showcase the cuML features that you could use to improve model performance on your own.

In this case, we are interested in finding a robust preprocessing protocol to apply to unseen data, so we will perform [k-fold cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) and average performance across folds.\n",

Moreover, this is one of several sklearn algorithms that can be applied without incurring any device-to-host copies, so we will use it directly in our evaluation protocol.\n",

    "### 4.7 Generating New Features\n",
    "We have looked at several ways of processing existing features that may help a machine learning model converge faster or perform better, but we can also generate new features from the existing data to help create the best possible representation of those data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward examples of this technique is expemplified by the `PolynomialFeatureGenerator` algorithm. This algorithm works by looking at the products of existing features up to a certain order. Thus, if we have features `a`, `b`, and `c`, it might be useful to let the model see `ab`, `ac`, `bc` and potentially even `a**2`, `b**2`, and `c**2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will again take a fairly naive approach, adding all of the interaction terms of order 2 (corresponding to `ab`, `ac`, and `bc` in the above example) as new features."

    "## 5. Final Assessment\n",
    "Blindly applying the techniques presented thus far, we have seen a very modest increase in accuracy due solely to preprocessing. As evidenced by the ingenious solutions presented for the Kaggle competition associated with this dataset, a more careful and thorough exploration of preprocessing can yield much more impressive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key factor in finding an effective preprocessing protocol is how long it takes to iterate through possibilities and assess their impact. Indeed, this is one of the key benefits of cuML's new preprocessing tools. Using them, we can load data onto the GPU then tweak, transform, and use it for training and inference without ever incurring the cost of device-to-host transfers.\n",

    "Looking at these results, we can see the runtime benefit of GPU acceleration in both the entire preprocessing and classification pipeline and the preprocessing portion alone. For feature engineering, this means faster iteration, lower compute costs, and the possibility of conducting more systematic hyper-parameter optimization over even the preprocessing steps themselves. Those with an interest in HPO might check out our [detailed walkthroughs](https://rapids.ai/hpo) on performing HPO with RAPIDS in the cloud. The techniques explored there could easily be combined with those demonstrated in this notebook to rapidly search the space of available preprocessing and model hyperparameters."

    "## 6. Conclusions\n",
    "Thanks to the newly-expanded cuML preprocessing features in RAPIDS v0.16, it is now possible to keep your entire machine learning pipeline on the GPU, without copying data back to the host to make use of CPU-only algorithms. This offers substantial benefits in terms of runtime, which can in turn lead to more thorough exploration of the feature engineering space and dramatically lower compute times and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notebook primarily offers a high-level demonstration of available preprocessing features rather than an in-depth optimization of features on a particular dataset, you may be interested in using it to play more with the BNP dataset yourself to engineer the perfect combination of curated features. Or better yet, try it with your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like what you see here, there is plenty more to explore in our [other demo notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks). Please feel free to report any problems you find or ask questions via [the cuML issue tracker](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/issues), and keep an eye out for the next release of cuML (v0.17), which we expect to have an even smoother preprocessing experience as we start to transition the new preprocessing features out of experimental."
